The consumer of SPDX content wishes to preserve the name space mapping provided by such a producer.  In this case, the consumer would record the namespace map prefixes in the NamespaceMap such that subsequent serializations could reproduce the prefixes / namespaces in the native serialization format.\n2) An SPDX content producer wishing to maintain consistent prefix use and understanding across multiple different serialization formats of the produced content.\n   For example, an SBOM producer wishes to share/publish the SBOM as JSON-LD and XML. The producer can specify the preferred prefix mappings in the native serialization format using information from a single Namespacemap accessible local to the producer.\n3) An SPDX content consumer/producer wishing to maintain consistent prefix use while round tripping from SPDX content received, deserialized, modified/extended in some way, and then reserialized in the same serialization form.\n   In this case the prefix-namespace mappings utilized in the content are transformed from the original native namespace/prefix into the in memory NamespaceMap then transformed from the NamespaceMap back into the resultant serialization native namespace / prefix format.",

Enables a practical pipeline that\n * identifies gaps in SPDX that should be filled, \n * expresses solutions to those gaps in a way that allows the identifying adopters to use the extended solutions with SPDX and does not conflict with current SPDX,\n * can be clearly detected among the SPDX content exchange ecosystem,\n * provides a clear and structured definition of gap solution that can be used as submission for revision to SPDX standard",

A purl is a URL string which represents a package in a mostly universal and uniform way across programming languages, package managers, packaging conventions, tools, APIs and databases.\n\nthe purl URL string is defined by seven components:\n```\nscheme:type/namespace/name@version?qualifiers#subpath\n```\n\nThe definition for each component can be found in the [purl specification](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/blob/master/PURL-SPECIFICATION.rst). Components are designed such that they form a hierarchy from the most significant on the left to the least significant components on the right. \n\nParsing a purl string into its components works from left to right. Some extra type-specific normalizations are required. For more information, see [How to parse a purl string in its components](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/blob/master/PURL-SPECIFICATION.rst#how-to-parse-a-purl-string-in-its-components).",
